    <h1>Tandoori Chicken:</h1>

    <pre>
Skinless legs and thighs are marinated in a tenderizing mixture of yogurt, lemon juice, and spices and the meat is slashed to the bone in several places helping 
the marinade penetrate and the chicken cook more quickly.

The chicken gets its characteristic red hue from either lots of fiery chile or the addition of red food dye.

We're not that big on food dyes here, so we've skipped it, but if you must have your chicken bright red, feel free to add a bit of red food dye to the marinade.

You don't need a tandoor oven to make tandoori chicken! (Thank goodness). You can cook it over a grill (charcoal preferred) or just in an oven with a broiler.
